Traditional 2D inpainting models are typically not well-suited for this task as they cannot ensure multi-view consistency needed for 3D applications. NeRFiller introduces a generative 3D inpainting approach that leverages 2D generative models to fill in missing regions of a 3D scene, providing a more complete and consistent reconstruction.<br><br>\n---\n<h3>Introduction to NeRFiller</h3>\nNeRFiller is a framework designed to complete missing parts of a 3D scene by applying a 2D diffusion-based inpainting approach iteratively across multiple views, leading to a coherent and multi-view consistent 3D reconstruction. It builds on the NeRF (Neural Radiance Field) framework for rendering 3D scenes and uses a technique called the \"Grid Prior,\" which organizes views in a 2x2 grid for inpainting. This prior ensures that the resulting inpainted regions are more consistent across different perspectives.<br><br>\n---\n<h3>Architecture Design</h3>\nThe NeRFiller framework has several key components:\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>2D Diffusion Model:</strong> Generates inpainted regions by predicting noise across images in a tiled 2x2 grid format.</li>\n  <li><strong>Joint Multi-View Inpainting:</strong> Extends the Grid Prior to larger image sets by averaging noise across multiple images to achieve consistency.</li>\n  <li><strong>Iterative Dataset Update:</strong> Integrates inpainted images into the dataset gradually, allowing the NeRF model to update with multi-view consistent details over time.</li>\n</ul>\nThis combination of elements enables NeRFiller to create cohesive 3D scene completions, avoiding the inconsistencies typical of traditional 2D models applied to 3D tasks.<br><br>\n---\n<h3>Experiments and Results</h3>\nNeRFiller was evaluated across various 3D scenes and demonstrated significant improvements over other inpainting methods in creating consistent and realistic completions. Using metrics like PSNR and SSIM, NeRFiller outperformed baselines in retaining visual quality and realism. Notably, it achieved strong performance on scenes with substantial missing data, showcasing its ability to fill in large, unobserved areas effectively.<br><br>\n---\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\nNeRFiller provides a novel solution for 3D scene completion by combining 2D generative inpainting with multi-view consistency techniques. By ensuring coherence across perspectives, it represents a step forward in making 3D reconstructions more complete and reliable for real-world applications. The authors suggest that this method can improve applications in fields such as virtual reality, digital restoration, and autonomous navigation, where complete 3D environments are essential.\n `);\n    } else {\n      setSummary(\"This is a brief summary of the paper's content.

However, widespread use has been limited due to the closed nature of existing VLAs and their challenges in fine-tuning for specific robotic tasks. This study introduces OpenVLA, a fully open-source, large-scale model that builds on recent advancements in VLA models by offering both accessible architecture and efficient fine-tuning for diverse robotic tasks.<br><br>\n---\n<h3>Introduction to OpenVLA</h3>\nOpenVLA is a 7B-parameter VLA model that integrates visual and language inputs to generate robotic actions. The model is pretrained on 970,000 robot demonstrations from the Open X-Embodiment dataset, covering multiple robots and tasks. OpenVLA combines a vision encoder with pretrained features from DINOv2 and SigLIP and uses a Llama 2 language model as its backbone. This approach allows OpenVLA to learn and generalize across various environments, outperforming prior closed models in terms of success rates with a fraction of the parameters.<br><br>\n---\n<h3>Architecture Design</h3>\nOpenVLA's architecture includes:\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Visual Encoder:</strong> Uses features from DINOv2 and SigLIP to capture spatial and semantic information.</li>\n  <li><strong>Language Model (Llama 2):</strong> Translates visual data and language instructions into a sequence of tokens representing robot actions.</li>\n  <li><strong>Fine-Tuning Mechanism:</strong> Adapts efficiently to new robot environments with low-rank adaptation techniques, making it compatible with consumer-grade GPUs.</li>\n</ul>\nThis architecture allows for both complex multi-robot control and rapid adaptation to new settings, distinguishing it from other VLA models focused on specific tasks.<br><br>\n---\n<h3>Experiments and Results</h3>\nOpenVLA was tested on multiple robots and tasks, achieving a 16.5% improvement over the 55B-parameter RT-2-X model in task success rates across 29 robotic tasks. It showed notable generalization to new environments and objects while using significantly fewer parameters. The model also demonstrated strong language grounding, allowing it to follow complex instructions involving specific objects and actions accurately.<br><br>\n---\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\nOpenVLA is a robust, open-source VLA model that supports generalization across various robotic tasks and environments. With its accessible design and adaptability to different setups, OpenVLA provides a valuable resource for advancing robotic control research. The authors anticipate that OpenVLA will foster innovation in VLA research, offering an adaptable and powerful base for future studies and applications.\n`);\n    } else if (uploadedFile === \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.04560\") {\n      setSummary(`NeRFiller: Completing Scenes via Generative 3D Inpainting<br><br>\n<strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Weber, Aleksander Hołyński, Varun Jampani, Saurabh Saxena, Noah Snavely, Abhishek Kar, Angjoo Kanazawa<br>\n<strong>Source:</strong> Google Research, UC Berkeley<br><br>\n---\n<h3>Background</h3>\n3D scene completion is a challenging area where parts of a scene or object may be missing due to limitations in capturing or reconstructing 3D data. Traditional 2D inpainting models are typically not well-suited for this task as they cannot ensure multi-view consistency needed for 3D applications. NeRFiller introduces a generative 3D inpainting approach that leverages 2D generative models to fill in missing regions of a 3D scene, providing a more complete and consistent reconstruction.<br><br>\n---\n<h3>Introduction to NeRFiller</h3>\nNeRFiller is a framework designed to complete missing parts of a 3D scene by applying a 2D diffusion-based inpainting approach iteratively across multiple views, leading to a coherent and multi-view consistent 3D reconstruction. It builds on the NeRF (Neural Radiance Field) framework for rendering 3D scenes and uses a technique called the \"Grid Prior,\" which organizes views in a 2x2 grid for inpainting. This prior ensures that the resulting inpainted regions are more consistent across different perspectives.<br><br>\n---\n<h3>Architecture Design</h3>\nThe NeRFiller framework has several key components:\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>2D Diffusion Model:</strong> Generates inpainted regions by predicting noise across images in a tiled 2x2 grid format.</li>\n  <li><strong>Joint Multi-View Inpainting:</strong> Extends the Grid Prior to larger image sets by averaging noise across multiple images to achieve consistency.</li>\n  <li><strong>Iterative Dataset Update:</strong> Integrates inpainted images into the dataset gradually, allowing the NeRF model to update with multi-view consistent details over time.</li>\n</ul>\nThis combination of elements enables NeRFiller to create cohesive 3D scene completions, avoiding the inconsistencies typical of traditional 2D models applied to 3D tasks.<br><br>\n---\n<h3>Experiments and Results</h3>\nNeRFiller was evaluated across various 3D scenes and demonstrated significant improvements over other inpainting methods in creating consistent and realistic completions. Using metrics like PSNR and SSIM, NeRFiller outperformed baselines in retaining visual quality and realism. Notably, it achieved strong performance on scenes with substantial missing data, showcasing its ability to fill in large, unobserved areas effectively.<br><br>\n---\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\nNeRFiller provides a novel solution for 3D scene completion by combining 2D generative inpainting with multi-view consistency techniques. By ensuring coherence across perspectives, it represents a step forward in making 3D reconstructions more complete and reliable for real-world applications. The authors suggest that this method can improve applications in fields such as virtual reality, digital restoration, and autonomous navigation, where complete 3D environments are essential.\n `);\n    } else {\n      setSummary(\"This is a brief summary of the paper's content.
